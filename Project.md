# Project Description

Our Final Project focuses on the Asian Community. With this project we wish to provide resources and interactive maps. We are focusing on three areas: Asian Demographic, Asian Hate Crime, and Asian Restaurants &
Communities. The data from these maps were collected from diverse source. A special thank you to Stop AAPI for providing us with data and giving us the opportunity to gather primary data. The tools to build these visualization were primarily Altair (a python library).
